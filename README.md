A personal project aimed at learning React and practicing web page creation by cloning the [WordHuntle](https://www.wordhuntle.com) website.

## Introduction

This project is a personal endeavor to enhance React skills and gain hands-on experience in web page development. By creating a clone of the popular [WordHuntle](https://www.wordhuntle.com) website, I aim to dive into the world of React components, state management, and responsive design.

## Features

- Interactive word search game.
- Timed challenges to find as many words as possible.
- Basic score tracking.
- Simplified user interface inspired by the original WordHuntle design.
